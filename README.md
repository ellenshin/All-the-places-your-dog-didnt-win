Your dog just won X place in a dog show, congratulations! You post your star's photo and placement announcement to /r/aww and, predictably, a funny redditor asks what places the rest of the participating dogs took. Your job is to create a program that lists all places within the range of 0-100 in spoken English, excluding the placing (X) of your winning pup.
